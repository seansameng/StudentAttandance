# User Management System Testing Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
The user management system is not working properly. This guide will help you test and debug the system.

## 🔧 **What I've Fixed**

1. **Added missing activities to AndroidManifest.xml**:
   - `AddUserActivity`
   - `EditUserActivity`

2. **Fixed icon references**:
   - Changed add user button from `ic_edit` to `ic_add`
   - Changed floating action button from `ic_edit` to `ic_add`

3. **Added database testing functionality**:
   - Changed "Bulk Actions" button to "Test Database"
   - Added sample user creation for testing

## 📱 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Access User Management**
1. Launch the app
2. Login as an admin user (username: `admin`, password: `123456`)
3. Navigate to Admin Panel
4. Select "User Management" tab

### **Step 2: Test Database Connection**
1. Click the "Test Database" button (formerly "Bulk Actions")
2. This will:
   - Test if the database is accessible
   - Create sample users if none exist
   - Show a toast message with the result

### **Step 3: Check for Sample Users**
If the database test is successful, you should see:
- **Admin User**: admin / admin123
- **Teacher User**: teacher1 / teacher123  
- **Student User**: student1 / student123

### **Step 4: Test User Management Features**
1. **Add User**: Click the "Add New User" button or floating action button
2. **View User**: Click on any user in the list
3. **Edit User**: Long-press on a user and select "Edit User"
4. **Delete User**: Use the delete button in edit/view mode

## 🐛 **Debugging Steps**

### **Check Logs**
Look for these log tags in Android Studio:
- `UserManagementFragment`
- `AdminFragment`
- `DataRepository`

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Access Denied" Message**:
   - Check if you're logged in as admin
   - Verify user role in SessionManager

2. **"No Users Found"**:
   - Click "Test Database" button
   - Check database connection

3. **Layout Issues**:
   - Verify all drawable resources exist
   - Check if layout files are properly inflated

4. **Database Errors**:
   - Check if Room database is initialized
   - Verify database schema version

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **In Logs**:
```
UserManagementFragment: Creating user management view...
UserManagementFragment: Views initialized successfully
UserManagementFragment: RecyclerView setup completed
UserManagementFragment: Loading users data...
UserManagementFragment: Database test - Current users count: X
```

### **In UI**:
- User statistics cards showing counts
- User list with sample data
- Search and filter functionality
- Add/Edit/Delete buttons working

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior**

When working correctly, you should see:
1. **Header**: "User Management" with description
2. **Statistics Cards**: Total, Admin, Teacher, Student counts
3. **Action Buttons**: "Add New User" and "Test Database"
4. **Search & Filter**: Search bar and role/sort dropdowns
5. **User List**: RecyclerView showing users with options
6. **Floating Action Button**: Quick add user access

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working**

3. **Check SessionManager** for user authentication
4. **Verify all activities** are declared in manifest
5. **Check drawable resources** exist and are accessible

## 📞 **Support**

If you continue to have issues:
1. Share the logcat output
2. Describe what you see on screen
3. Mention any error messages
4. Specify which step fails
